NOT A PUBLIC SERVICE

This service wraps key functions from the ERDB database layer to allow 
querying the CDS via the ERDB system with clients generated by the type 
compiler.
This service should never be exposed publically.

The deployment requirements are:

- deployed kbase services should be able to access the ERDB service.
- services on Magellan instances should be able to access the ERDB service.
- any service calls originating outside kbase should not have access to the 
service.

So, for example, access to the service could be blocked other than for 
internal kbase IPs at nginx for this service, although no particular
implementation is advocated here.
